How much do I really know? How much has it ever shown?
Of all the stars that shine above or clouds that come and go
You can ask me all their names, but I'm really not sure to claim
I was born here on this island, yet still I cannot say

But I know deep inside, something money could never buy
All the times that I've cried and the tears that have dried
It all happened right here under this sky

So many things are kept in darkness
In all the textbooks we blindly follow
No matter what you've heard in the papers
Believe me, there's more to be seen
That is the treasure of my home, our island dream

How much do I understand? How much do I really see?
Of all the dying coral and the life under the seas
How are we to repossess, and give breath to what is left?
You could ask me for solutions, still I can't explain

But I know deep inside, something money could never buy
I can tell in the tides to the waves that I ride
The ocean is changing before my eyes

So many things that are never spoken
On the radio and television
No matter how clear the pictures appear
Believe me, there's more to be seen
That is the treasure of my home, our island dream

How much do I perceive? How much there is to be?
To the words which are sung to these island harmonies
Tuva Rama lullabies, Densa melodies
I can't even define for you what they really mean

But I know deep inside, something money could never buy
Of the joy that they bring when we hear them all sing
While we're dancing through the night until sunrise

Inside of me I will always cherish
The memories of the love I've shared
No matter how far we are apart now, my heart is there to stay cause
That is the treasure of my home, our island dream
